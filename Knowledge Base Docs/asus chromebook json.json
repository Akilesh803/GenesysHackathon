It's also based on the date the platform was first released, so - if you buy an older Chromebook that has been on the market for 6 years, let's say, you'll only have 6 months of support left. The auto update policy for Chrome OS can be found here: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en. This can be really frustrating because the hardware isn't necessarily obsolete. For example, I own both an original Chromebook Pixel and the first Samsung Chromebox. They both have Pentium Core processors and plenty of RAM and SSD, but both have been dropped from updates. Contrary to what others have said in answer to this question, none of my now obsolete devices have continued to receive updates and you can't force an update because there are no new images for those particular boards. Since some of the missed updates have been pretty important - like the Meltdown and Spectre patches - I no longer use those devices. I guess you can think of it this way: You're leasing a Chromebook for 6.5 years and then it will be a paperweight. The upside is that you can install a linux distribution on some of the newer Chrome OS devices and keep them up to date that way, but they will no longer be a Chromebook at that point. see less Chromebooks have guaranteed update support for 6.5 years from the first launch for a new hardware platform (which could mean less time for a particular Chromebook, if it is launched later than the first Chromebook to use that hardware).
